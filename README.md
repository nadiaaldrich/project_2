## Background:

The UN Refugee Agency, [**UNHCR**](https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/about-us.html), is a global organization dedicated to saving lives, protecting rights and building a better future for refugees, forcibly displaced communities and stateless people.

This agency gathers data that covers the movement of displaced persons.

#### **Our goal was to create an interactive web application to help us visualize the movement of these people.** 



## Data Used:

File Name | Contents
------------ | -------------
**asylumseekersmonthly.csv** | country, month, year, # of refugees
**demographics.csv** | country, total males, total females 
**coordinates_file.csv** | country, lat, long, # of refugees



## Development: 
-  `jupyter notebook` to rename and delete columns
-  created databases in `PostgresSQL`
-  `Python` and `Flask` to create APIs
-  `Javascript, D3.js, Leaflet, Mapbox, CSS, Bootstrap, Beautify.js` 
-  deployment with `Heroku`
