## Background:

**UNHCR**, the UN Refugee Agency, is a global organization dedicated to saving lives, protecting rights and building a better future for refugees, forcibly displaced communities and stateless people.

This agency gathers data that covers the movement of displaced persons (asylum seekers, refugees, internally displaced persons (IDP), and stateless). 

## Our goal was to create an interactive web application to help us visualize the movement of these people. 

## Content:
This dataset includes 6 csv files covering:

Asylum monthly applications opened (asylumseekersmonthly.csv)
Yearly progress through the refugee system (asylum_seekers.csv)
Refugee demographics (demographics.csv)
Yearly time series data on UNHCRâ€™s populations of concern (time_series.csv)
Yearly population statistics on refugees by residence and destination (personsofconcern.csv)
Yearly data on resettlement arrivals, with or without UNHCR assistance (resettlement.csv)

### Created with Flask, Python 3.6 and PostGres.
Additional tools: D3.js, Plotly.js, JQuery, Leaflet, Mapbox, Javascript, Tweepy, CSS-grid.

Deployment: Heroku.
