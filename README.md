# Background:

The UN Refugee Agency, [**UNHCR**](https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/about-us.html), is a global organization dedicated to saving lives, protecting rights and building a better future for refugees, forcibly displaced communities and stateless people.

This agency gathers data that covers the movement of displaced persons.

---

# Objective: 

## Create an interactive web application to help us visualize the movement of people seeking refuge and to answer the following:


## 1. What are the top 25 countries hosting refugees?
## 2. What are the total number of refugees by year?
## 3. What does the concentration of refugees look like globally in 2016?
